# Steps to predict the product price.

1. Read the training dataset through pandas

2. Checked if NA values present in dataset or not.

3. Aggregated min_value and max_value column in single column by taking average.

4. NA values present in columns containing data type int or float is rectified through taking mean.

5. Dropped customer_name column from dataset as it contains null values.

6. Converted all input features to numerical type by using OrdinalEncoder.

7. Columns with limited labels like product_category and grade is then seperated from input features.

8. Applied onehot encodeing to them and appended back to input features.

9. Then for training and testing the model, I splitted the data in 9:1 ratio.

10. By trial and testing created model with diiferent dense layers with mixture of 'relu' and 'tanh' as activation fuction to it.

11. Used Adam optimiser with mean squared error as loss function and trained the model.

12. Saved the model.

13. For test.csv repeated the same step till model creation.

14. loaded the saved model and get the predicted values.

15. Stored in submission.csv file as per given format.
